# Visual Studio Code

My current favorite code editor to date is Visual Studio Code (VSCode). I love the modularity it offers, and the expansive set of languages it supports (and will support in the future).

## Preferred Uses

I tend to use VSCode when reading and writing files in/on/for the following languages and platforms:

- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS
- Data Encapsulation Formats (JSON/XML)
