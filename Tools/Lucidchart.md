# Lucidchart

Since December 2021, I've used Lucidchart for all of my diagramming needs. This includes, but is not limited to:

- E-R Diagrams
- UI mockups (experimenting with Adobe XD)
- Flow charts
- System Architecture diagrams
- Other UML diagrams

Before this tool, I used Diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) from 2016/2017 to 2021. For E-R diagrams, I switched to DBDiagram.io in 2019, but decided to consolidate to a singular diagramming platform.
