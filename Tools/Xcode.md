# Xcode
While I don't use Xcode very often, it's still an IDE I install on every Mac I've owned, for those one-off situations where I need it.

## Preferred Uses
I tend to use Xcode when reading and writing files in/on/for the following languages and platforms:
- Objective-C
- Swift
- C
- C++
- Apple environments (macOS, iOS)
