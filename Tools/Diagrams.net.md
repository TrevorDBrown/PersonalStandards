# Diagrams.net

Since 2016/2017, I've used Diagrams.net (formerly draw.io) for all of my diagramming needs. This includes, but is not limited to:

- E-R Diagrams (recently switched to dbdiagram.io)
- UI mockups (experimenting with Adobe XD)
- Flow charts
- System Architecture diagrams
- Other UML diagrams
