# Personal Standards and Practices for Software Development
These are my personal standards, templates, and snippets for various project types. 

Please note: these are my personal preferences of how I approach programming, and are always subject to change. This repository was created for me to keep track of how I would like to approach consistency in my code, across projects and languages.

I was inspired by Mick West's article on his blog, Cowboy Programming, about his coding practices from 1991 (http://cowboyprogramming.com/2008/11/15/my-coding-practices-in-1991/), and thought I should develop my own personal standards and practices in my own work.

If these practices are fitting for your needs and preferences, please use them (by all means!) Also, I'm always open to new approaches that may be to my benefit as a developer. So, please file issues in this repository, if you have any suggestions, questions, comments, or concerns!

Thanks, and God bless!
