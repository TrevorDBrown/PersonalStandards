# Tabs
In the Tabs vs. Spaces debate, I'm always pro-Tabs, with a preference of 4 spaces = 1 tab. So, all files are tabbed.

When viewing this file in your editor of choice, the asterisks (*) on each line should line up.
```
*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
*...*...*...*...*...*...*...*...*...*...*
