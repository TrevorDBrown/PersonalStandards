# File Naming

File names are another challenge in software development (as trivial as they sound).

I'm still not very consistent, but I tend to prefer the following structure:

- filename.ext - filenames where the context is very simplistic (i.e. app.ts, queries.json, words.txt, etc.)
- filename_filename_..._filename.ext - multi-part filenames, where spaces are replaced with underscores (\_) (i.e. word_processor.c, client_interface.ts, etc.)

The ideal filenames are all lowercase, where spaces are replaced with underscores (\_), usually referred to as Snake_Case. camelCase is never used for file names. Although, depending on the language, PascalCase may be used. For example, in Java, filenames for class files are PascalCase (i.e. ClassName.class).
